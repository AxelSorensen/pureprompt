# PurePrompt - An easy tool for prompt robustness and eval augmentation

PurePrompt is an advanced tool for optimizing AI prompt engineering through its three key components: Prompt, Generate, and Evaluate. The Prompt page enables users to create and refine prompt templates with placeholder variables. The Generate page automatically produces diverse test cases, allowing users to control token limits and import predefined examples. The Evaluate page runs these test cases across selected AI models to assess prompt robustness, with users rating responses to identify issues. This tool enhances efficiency in prompt testing, improves AI safety by detecting biases, and helps refine model performance. Future plans include beta-testing, expanding model support, and enhancing prompt customization features.
